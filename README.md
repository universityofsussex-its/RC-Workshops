<!-- BASIC EXERCISES -->
## Basic Exercises

The Basic Exercies are for first time users of a HPC system. It is advised that all new users to the Sussex HPC at least review the exercises and attempt to complete them. The exercies are given within a workshop but you may also attempt them on their own. Please be advised you may need to review the policies and rules for use of the HPC if not attending a workshop where these are explained. 

The Exercies are expected to take around 2h to complete, based on a 2-4h workshop. If you are currently attending a workshop, it should have already been mentioned that you are not expected to complete each exercise during the allotted time in the workshop. We expect you to complete these exercises after the workshop and contact the Research Team for additional help if needed via the slack channel. (See workshop invite for details).
